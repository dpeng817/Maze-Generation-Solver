TODOLIST
Three Parts:
	- Maze Generation
	- Maze Processing
	- Maze Solving

1. Maze Generation
	- Randomized Kruskal's Tree Spanning
	- Randomized DFS
	- Randomized Recursive Backtracking

2. Maze Processing
	- Convert maze into array representation, iterate through

3. Maze Solving
	- Wall Follower
	- A*
	- BFS

Graphical User Interface:
	- Dropdown for which algorithm to use for maze creation
	- Text boxes for maze size

Possible Future Improvements:
	- Add maze recognition ML
	- Maze solving ML, trained on mazes created by each of the different algorithms

-DFS: still not reaching all corners
-Develop tool to convert to image
